# IVGAS-Bot
Bot for the IVGAS Discord by @BreakTruth

## Installation
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. clone this git.
3. Go to the file `keys-preset.json`, and fill out the strings with API keys and tokens for the services needed, then rename it to `keys.json`.
4. to run the bot just write `npm start` in your command-line. If you have something like `nodemon` which allows it to re-execute the bot when files are added/removed/saved, instead of doing that every time you have changes, you would do `nodemon index.js`.
